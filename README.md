This is Group Eleven's ZooHackathon 2020 project deployment/sharing point.
It's a functioning demo, showing the possibilities of "gamefying" the combat againt wildlife animal trafficking.

What it does:
1. Allows the user to select a username and log in with that name.
2. Allows the user to enter in "anonymous" (guest) mode, so its activities are not logged.
3. Counts user contributions and ranks it (if logged in).
4. User may select files to upload.
5. User may post messages on its area.
6. Contributions add to the global total.

What it does not do:
1. Doesn't create user accounts, so progress is not saved across sessions or if the application Page is reloaded.
2. Doesn't keep permanent data, so contributions are not stored.
3. Doesn't send any datum anywhere, so the "Register" button simply clears the input fields.
4. Doesn't validate data, or process them in any way, except for populating the Mapper's posts.
5. Doesn't count global total (the initial number is randomly generated).
6. Doesn't actually manage the message board (obviously, sensible data, like location and crime being committed, shouldn't be publicly visible, only to the poster itself).
