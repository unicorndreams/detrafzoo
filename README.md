This is Group Eleven's ZooHackathon 2020 project deployment/sharing point.
It's a functioning demo, showing the possibilities of "gamefying" the combat againt wildlife animal trafficking.

What it does:
1. Allows the user to select a username and log in with that name.
2. Allows the user to enter in "anonymous guest" mode, so its activities are not logged.
3. Counts user contributions and ranks it.
4. User may select files to upload.

What it does not do:
1. Doesn't create user accounts, so progress is not saved across sessions or if the application Page is reloaded.
2. Doesn't keep permanent data, so contributions are not stored.
3. Doesn't send any datum anywhere, so the "Register" button simply clears the input fields.
4. Doesn't validate data, or process them in any way.
